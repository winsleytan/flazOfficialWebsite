<p>
    Hi! My name is Flaz. I’m a budding programmer excited to dive into the world of coding and problem-solving.
    Currently, I’m focused on building my skills in programming 
    languages and exploring how technology can create innovative solutions. 
</p>

<p>I love the process of learning—figuring out new concepts and tackling challenges one step at a time. 
    While I’m still in the early stages, I’m eager to grow, take on new projects, and contribute to meaningful work. 
    Outside of coding, I enjoy adding a bit of humor and spontaneity to my day, because I believe learning should be both challenging and fun. 
</p>

<h2>Overall, I’m JUST A CHILL GUY who enjoys going with the flow, staying grounded, 
    and keeping life as stress-free as possible.</h2>
